## Badge System Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Player Stats Input** → Raw game performance data
2. **Badge Evaluation** → Requirements checking against thresholds
3. **Progress Calculation** → Percentage completion for unearned badges
4. **Tier Assessment** → Highest achieved tier per badge category
5. **UI Rendering** → Visual badge display with metadata

### Extensibility
- **Easy badge addition**: New badges via BADGE_DEFINITIONS array
- **Custom requirements**: Flexible requirement operators and periods
- **Role-specific badges**: Support for position-specific recognition
- **Dynamic thresholds**: Configurable based on meta changes

## Implementation Highlights

### Following AGENTS.md Specifications
- ✅ **16 Badge Categories** as specified in Table 4.1
- ✅ **Role-specific recognition** (Teleport Master for Top, Peel Specialist for Support/Tank)
- ✅ **Temporal performance tracking** (Early Game vs Late Game badges)
- ✅ **Strategic intelligence recognition** beyond KDA metrics
- ✅ **Adaptive thresholds** for different skill levels
- ✅ **Positive framing** to avoid tilting effects

### Technical Achievements
- ✅ **Icon compatibility** - Fixed FaShield → FaShieldAlt import issues
- ✅ **Type safety** - Resolved TypeScript conflicts in PerformanceInsights
- ✅ **Build success** - Clean compilation with no errors
- ✅ **Tauri integration** - Compatible with desktop application framework

### Demo Features
- **Mock Data Generation**: Realistic player stats for testing
- **Interactive Badge System**: Live badge calculation and display
- **Visual Feedback**: Progress bars, tier colors, category icons
- **Responsive Layout**: Works across different screen sizes

## Current Status
- ✅ **Core badge system**: Fully implemented and working
- ✅ **UI Components**: Complete with interactive features
- ✅ **Integration**: Added to dashboard and match views
- ✅ **Testing**: Mock data generation for demonstration
- ✅ **Build System**: Clean compilation and error resolution

## Next Steps for Production
1. **Real Data Integration**: Connect to actual Riot API data
2. **Backend Storage**: Persist badge progress and achievements
3. **User Authentication**: Link badges to specific summoner accounts
4. **Performance Optimization**: Caching and efficient calculation
5. **Badge Notifications**: Achievement celebrations and alerts

## Files Modified/Created
